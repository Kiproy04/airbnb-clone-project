# airbnb-clone-project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security.

# Team Roles
1) Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
2) Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
3) DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
4) QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

# Technology Stack
1) Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
2) Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
3) PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
4) GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
5) Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
6) Redis: Used for caching and session management.
7) Docker: A Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
8) CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

# Database Design
Entities & Fields:

1) Users
id, name, email, password_hash, role
2) Properties
id, title, location, description, host_id (FK)
3) Bookings
id, user_id (FK), property_id (FK), check_in, check_out, status
4) Reviews
id, user_id (FK), property_id (FK), rating, comment
5) Payments
id, booking_id (FK), amount, payment_method, status

Relationships:
- A User can host multiple Properties.
- A Property can have many Bookings and Reviews.
- A Booking is linked to one Property and one User.
- A Payment is tied to one Booking.

# Feature Breakdown
1. API Documentation
OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
Django REST Framework: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.
2. User Authentication
Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
3. Property Management
Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
4. Booking System
Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
5. Payment Processing
Endpoints: /payments/
Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
6. Review System
Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.
7. Database Optimizations
Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

# API Security
1) Authentication: Token-based (e.g., JWT) for secured login and protected routes.
2) Authorization: Role-based access for host, guest, and admin permissions.
3) Rate Limiting: Prevent abuse of public-facing endpoints.
4) Data Encryption: Protect sensitive user data and credentials.

# CI/CD Pipeline
1) Continuous Integration (CI): Automatically test, lint, and build the application upon pull requests.
2) Continuous Deployment (CD): Automatically deploy to a testing or production environment.
   
Tools:
1. GitHub Actions for running workflows.
2. Docker for containerization and portability.
3. (Optional) AWS/GCP/Heroku for hosting.
